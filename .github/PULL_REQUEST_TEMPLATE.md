## What and why

<!-- What does this change, and why? Link the issue it closes, if any. For an image bump, link the service's
release notes and say whether it migrates the service's data. For an engine upgrade, follow docs/upgrading.md and
say when it will be merged (merging restarts every app's database). -->
